# How it works?
You can run the application file using python3 and use it!

# Structure

Files are structured this way:

Backend

 --- Node (class node)
 
 --- Errors
 
Frontend

 --- app (application ui/ux classes)
 
 --- AppState (app information class)
 
 --- ExtendedWidget (main ui class)
 
Libs (all the nodes are stored in libs)
